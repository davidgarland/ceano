# Ceano

Ceano is a little library for C preprocessor macros.

A lot of the ideas are borrowed from random places, and it's mostly
just for fun-- I don't foresee most of this being extremely useful for
real projects.

## Featuring
- ~~Zero-cost abstractions~~
- Peano naturals that may be converted to integers.
- Peano addition and multiplication.
- Church booleans that may be converted to integers.
- Reflective equality checking for simple proofs.
